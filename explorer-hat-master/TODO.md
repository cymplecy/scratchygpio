#TODO/ROADMAP

This document details what's ideally coming next in Explorer HAT. It's a good port of call if you want to make useful
contributions to the library itself, or if you want to check if a feature is already on the cards before suggesting.

###General Todo

* Better support for Python's built-in dir() and help() functions if and where possible
* Removal of method aliases ( changed / on_changed for example ), canonicalizing on those in the function reference

###Motor

* Implementation of speed() method with variable speed from -100 to +100

###Cap Touch

* Support for changing sensitivity/gain on individual pads
* Ability to specify repeat rate
